The computer you are using this on must have installed the following:

- Google Chrome (at C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe)
- 7-Zip (at C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe)

## Setting up

1. Go to `chrome_extensions_82379/background.js` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own API key.
2. Archive the folder `chrome_extensions_82379`
3. Upload to a file sharing website (discord doesn't work), like [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/) (for temporary uploads)
4. Get the link and inside `run.bat` set the `URL` variable to the link
5. Upload the `run.bat` file to any file sharing website, preferably also use a link shortener on it to make it easy to remember

## Usage

1. Download the run.bat file from the link you uploaded it to, allow the download
2. Open the run.bat file, allow the file to run
3. (Optional) Pin the extension to the chrome toolbar

The `run.bat` file will self-destruct after running.  
The extension only works in the opened chrome window, if you close it, the extension will be gone.
